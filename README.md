### Kubernetes Integration (Optional)

We think Kubernetes is awesome, but it is not a must to get started with remote execution agents and cluster management.
We designed `clearml-agent` so you can run both bare-metal and on top of Kubernetes, in any combination that fits your environment.

You can find the Dockerfiles in the [docker folder](./docker) and the helm Chart in https://github.com/clearml/clearml-helm-charts

#### Benefits of integrating existing Kubernetes cluster with ClearML

- ClearML-Agent adds the missing scheduling capabilities to your Kubernetes cluster
- Users do not need to have direct Kubernetes access!
- Easy learning curve with UI and CLI requiring no DevOps knowledge from end users
- Unlike other solutions, ClearML-Agents work in tandem with other customers of your Kubernetes cluster 
- Allows for more flexible automation from code, building pipelines and visibility
- A programmatic interface for easy CI/CD workflows, enabling GitOps to trigger jobs inside your cluster
- Seamless integration with the ClearML ML/DL/GenAI experiment manager
- Web UI for customization, scheduling & prioritization of jobs
- **Enterprise Features**: RBAC, vault, multi-tenancy, scheduler, quota management, fractional GPU support 

**Run the agent in Kubernetes Glue mode an map ClearML jobs directly to K8s jobs:**
- Use the [ClearML Agent Helm Chart](https://github.com/clearml/clearml-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/clearml-agent) to spin an agent pod acting as a controller
  - Or run the [clearml-k8s glue](https://github.com/clearml/clearml-agent/blob/master/examples/k8s_glue_example.py) on
    a Kubernetes cpu node
- The clearml-k8s glue pulls jobs from the ClearML job execution queue and prepares a Kubernetes job (based on provided
  yaml template)
- Inside each pod the clearml-agent will install the job (experiment) environment and spin and monitor the
  experiment's process, fully visible in the clearml UI
- Benefits: Kubernetes full view of all running jobs in the system
- **Enterprise Features**
  - Full scheduler features added on Top of Kubernetes, with quota/over-quota management, priorities and order.
  - Fractional GPU support, allowing multiple isolated containers sharing the same GPU with memory/compute limit per container 

### SLURM (Optional)

Yes! Slurm integration is available, check the [documentation](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/clearml_agent/#slurm) for further details 

### Using the ClearML Agent

**Full scale HPC with a click of a button**

The ClearML Agent is a job scheduler that listens on job queue(s), pulls jobs, sets the job environments, executes the
job and monitors its progress.

Any 'Draft' experiment can be scheduled for execution by a ClearML agent.

A previously run experiment can be put into 'Draft' state by either of two methods:

* Using the **'Reset'** action from the experiment right-click context menu in the ClearML UI - This will clear any
  results and artifacts the previous run had created.
* Using the **'Clone'** action from the experiment right-click context menu in the ClearML UI - This will create a new 
  'Draft' experiment with the same configuration as the original experiment.

An experiment is scheduled for execution using the **'Enqueue'** action from the experiment right-click context menu in
the ClearML UI and selecting the execution queue.

See [creating an experiment and enqueuing it for execution](#from-scratch).

Once an experiment is enqueued, it will be picked up and executed by a ClearML Agent monitoring this queue.

The ClearML UI Workers & Queues page provides ongoing execution information:

- Workers Tab: Monitor you cluster
    - Review available resources
    - Monitor machines statistics (CPU / GPU / Disk / Network)
- Queues Tab:
    - Control the scheduling order of jobs
    - Cancel or abort job execution
    - Move jobs between execution queues

#### What The ClearML Agent Actually Does

The ClearML Agent executes experiments using the following process:

- Create a new virtual environment (or launch the selected docker image)
- Clone the code into the virtual-environment (or inside the docker)
- Install python packages based on the package requirements listed for the experiment
    - Special note for PyTorch: The ClearML Agent will automatically select the torch packages based on the CUDA_VERSION
      environment variable of the machine
- Execute the code, while monitoring the process
- Log all stdout/stderr in the ClearML UI, including the cloning and installation process, for easy debugging
- Monitor the execution and allow you to manually abort the job using the ClearML UI (or, in the unfortunate case of a
  code crash, catch the error and signal the experiment has failed)

#### System Design & Flow

<img src="https://github.com/clearml/clearml-agent/blob/master/docs/clearml_architecture.png" width="100%" alt="clearml-architecture">

#### Installing the ClearML Agent

```bash
pip install clearml-agent
```

#### ClearML Agent Usage Examples

Full Interface and capabilities are available with

```bash
clearml-agent --help
clearml-agent daemon --help
```

#### Configuring the ClearML Agent

```bash
clearml-agent init
```

Note: The ClearML Agent uses a cache folder to cache pip packages, apt packages and cloned repositories. The default
ClearML Agent cache folder is `~/.clearml`.

See full details in your configuration file at `~/clearml.conf`.

Note: The **ClearML Agent** extends the **ClearML** configuration file `~/clearml.conf`.
They are designed to share the same configuration file, see example [here](docs/clearml.conf)

#### Running the ClearML Agent

For debug and experimentation, start the ClearML agent in `foreground` mode, where all the output is printed to screen:

```bash
clearml-agent daemon --queue default --foreground
```

For actual service mode, all the stdout will be stored automatically into a temporary file (no need to pipe).
Notice: with `--detached` flag, the *clearml-agent* will be running in the background

```bash
clearml-agent daemon --detached --queue default
```

GPU allocation is controlled via the standard OS environment `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` or `--gpus` flag (or disabled
with `--cpu-only`).

If no flag is set, and `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` variable doesn't exist, all GPUs will be allocated for
the `clearml-agent`. <br>
If `--cpu-only` flag is set, or `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="none"`, no gpu will be allocated for
the `clearml-agent`.

Example: spin two agents, one per GPU on the same machine:

Notice: with `--detached` flag, the *clearml-agent* will run in the background

```bash
clearml-agent daemon --detached --gpus 0 --queue default
clearml-agent daemon --detached --gpus 1 --queue default
```

Example: spin two agents, pulling from dedicated `dual_gpu` queue, two GPUs per agent

```bash
clearml-agent daemon --detached --gpus 0,1 --queue dual_gpu
clearml-agent daemon --detached --gpus 2,3 --queue dual_gpu
```

##### Starting the ClearML Agent in docker mode

For debug and experimentation, start the ClearML agent in `foreground` mode, where all the output is printed to screen

```bash
clearml-agent daemon --queue default --docker --foreground
```

For actual service mode, all the stdout will be stored automatically into a file (no need to pipe).
Notice: with `--detached` flag, the *clearml-agent* will run in the background

```bash
clearml-agent daemon --detached --queue default --docker
```

Example: spin two agents, one per gpu on the same machine, with default `nvidia/cuda:11.0.3-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu20.04`
docker:

```bash
clearml-agent daemon --detached --gpus 0 --queue default --docker nvidia/cuda:11.0.3-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu20.04
clearml-agent daemon --detached --gpus 1 --queue default --docker nvidia/cuda:11.0.3-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu20.04
```

Example: spin two agents, pulling from dedicated `dual_gpu` queue, two GPUs per agent, with default 
`nvidia/cuda:11.0.3-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu20.04` docker:

```bash
clearml-agent daemon --detached --gpus 0,1 --queue dual_gpu --docker nvidia/cuda:11.0.3-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu20.04
clearml-agent daemon --detached --gpus 2,3 --queue dual_gpu --docker nvidia/cuda:11.0.3-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu20.04
```

##### Starting the ClearML Agent - Priority Queues

Priority Queues are also supported, example use case:

High priority queue: `important_jobs`, low priority queue: `default`

```bash
clearml-agent daemon --queue important_jobs default
```

The **ClearML Agent** will first try to pull jobs from the `important_jobs` queue, and only if it is empty, the agent 
will try to pull from the `default` queue.

Adding queues, managing job order within a queue, and moving jobs between queues, is available using the Web UI, see
example on our [free server](https://app.clear.ml/workers-and-queues/queues)

##### Stopping the ClearML Agent

To stop a **ClearML Agent** running in the background, run the same command line used to start the agent with `--stop`
appended. For example, to stop the first of the above shown same machine, single gpu agents:

```bash
clearml-agent daemon --detached --gpus 0 --queue default --docker nvidia/cuda:11.0.3-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu20.04 --stop
```

### ClearML Agent Bootstrap

> Bootstrap is supported when using ClearML Agent version `3.0.0` and up.

The [`clearml-agent-bootstrap`](https://github.com/clearml/clearml-agent-bootstrap) package is a self-contained
initialization system that runs inside any container launched by the ClearML Agent. It ships precompiled binaries for
**Python**, **Git**, **ClearML Agent**, and essential utilities, so task containers do not need these tools
pre-installed.

When the agent launches a containerized task, the bootstrap script runs first: it detects the container's architecture
and distribution, sets up a working Python environment, ensures Git is available, and then hands off to the ClearML
Agent to execute the task.

**Why use it**

- **Faster cold starts** — precompiled binaries avoid slow package-manager installs at task launch time.
- **Broader container compatibility** — tasks can run in minimal images (Alpine, slim, distroless-adjacent) that lack Python or Git.
- **Consistent environments** — every task gets the same known-good toolchain regardless of the base image.
- **Offline support** — all critical binaries are bundled, no internet access is required for the initial setup.

Supports `x86_64` and `aarch64` architectures on any Linux distribution that provides `apt-get`, `dnf`, `yum`, or `apk`
(Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, RHEL, Fedora, Rocky Linux, Alpine, ...).

#### Bare-metal / VM usage

Install the agent (version 3.0.0 and up) and then install the bootstrap support:

```bash
pip install clearml-agent
clearml-agent install-bootstrap
```

This downloads the latest `clearml-agent-bootstrap` distribution and installs it locally. From this point on, when the
agent runs in docker mode, it will automatically unpack the bootstrap binaries, mount them into task containers, and
make sure the bootstrap script runs on container startup. The `install-bootstrap` command does not require a ClearML
server connection and can be run before `clearml-agent init`.

Common flags:

- `--check` — preview a dry-run of the command without making changes.
- `--force` — force reinstall even if the same version is already installed.
- `--version TAG` — install a specific release version (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
- `--from-file PATH` — install from a local `.whl` file instead of downloading from the official GitHub Releases.

#### Bootstrap and the uv package manager

The bootstrap ships a precompiled `uv` binary, and the bootstrap script exports its full path inside the task container
as `CLEARML_BOOTSTRAP_UV_EXEC` (usually `/tmp/.bootstrap.uv/uv`). When this variable is set, the agent runs every `uv`
command with that binary instead of looking for `uv` inside the task's virtual environment. Set `CLEARML_BOOTSTRAP_UV_EXEC` yourself only if you want to point the agent at a `uv` binary of your own.

The settings that control uv are independent of the bootstrap:

| Setting | Environment variable | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `agent.package_manager.type: uv` | `CLEARML_AGENT_FORCE_UV=1` | Use uv as the package manager. |
| `agent.package_manager.uv_replace_pip` | — | Use uv as a pip drop-in replacement, i.e. install the task's "installed packages" with uv instead of pip. The bootstrap turns this on implicitly, since a bootstrapped container may have no pip at all. |
| — | `CLEARML_BOOTSTRAP_UV_EXEC` | Full path of the `uv` binary to use. Exported by the bootstrap script. |

See `agent.bootstrap` in [`docs/clearml.conf`](docs/clearml.conf) for the remaining bootstrap options.

#### Kubernetes (Enterprise Helm chart)

> Bootstrap support for Kubernetes is available only in the ClearML Enterprise Agent Helm chart.

Enable bootstrap in your `clearml-agent-values.override.yaml`:

```yaml
bootstrap:
  enabled: true
```

#### More details

See the [agent-bootstrap README](https://github.com/clearml/clearml-agent-bootstrap) and the
[ClearML Agent Bootstrap docs](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/clearml_agent/clearml_agent_bootstrap) for full details.

### How do I create an experiment on the ClearML Server? <a name="from-scratch"></a>

* Integrate [ClearML](https://github.com/clearml/clearml) with your code
* Execute the code on your machine (Manually / PyCharm / Jupyter Notebook)
* As your code is running, **ClearML** creates an experiment logging all the necessary execution information:
    - Git repository link and commit ID (or an entire jupyter notebook)
    - Git diff (we’re not saying you never commit and push, but still...)
    - Python packages used by your code (including specific versions used)
    - Hyperparameters
    - Input artifacts

  You now have a 'template' of your experiment with everything required for automated execution

* In the ClearML UI, right-click on the experiment and select 'clone'. A copy of your experiment will be created.
* You now have a new draft experiment cloned from your original experiment, feel free to edit it
    - Change the hyperparameters
    - Switch to the latest code base of the repository
    - Update package versions
    - Select a specific docker image to run in (see docker execution mode section)
    - Or simply change nothing to run the same experiment again...
* Schedule the newly created experiment for execution: right-click the experiment and select 'enqueue'

### ClearML-Agent Services Mode <a name="services"></a>

ClearML-Agent Services is a special mode of ClearML-Agent that provides the ability to launch long-lasting jobs that
previously had to be executed on local / dedicated machines. It allows a single agent to launch multiple dockers (Tasks)
for different use cases: 
* Auto-scaler service (spinning instances when the need arises and the budget allows)
* Controllers (Implementing pipelines and more sophisticated DevOps logic)
* Optimizer (such as Hyperparameter Optimization or sweeping)
* Application (such as interactive Bokeh apps for increased data transparency)

ClearML-Agent Services mode will spin **any** task enqueued into the specified queue. Every task launched by
ClearML-Agent Services will be registered as a new node in the system, providing tracking and transparency capabilities.
Currently, clearml-agent in services-mode supports CPU only configuration. ClearML-Agent services mode can be launched
alongside GPU agents.

```bash
clearml-agent daemon --services-mode --detached --queue services --create-queue --docker ubuntu:18.04 --cpu-only
```

**Note**: It is the user's responsibility to make sure the proper tasks are pushed into the specified queue.

### Orchestration Pipelines <a name="orchestration-pipes"></a>

The ClearML Agent can also be used to implement orchestration and Experiment Pipelines in conjunction with the
ClearML package.

Sample Orchestration examples can be found in the
ClearML [example/automation](https://github.com/clearml/clearml/tree/master/examples/automation) folder.

Examples:

- [Toy Keras training experiment](https://github.com/clearml/clearml/blob/master/examples/optimization/hyper-parameter-optimization/base_template_keras_simple.py)
    - In order to create an experiment-template in the system, this code must be executed once manually
- [Random Search over the above Keras experiment-template](https://github.com/clearml/clearml/blob/master/examples/automation/manual_random_param_search_example.py)
    - This example will create multiple copies of the Keras experiment-template, with different hyperparameter
      combinations

Experiment Pipeline examples:

- [First step experiment](https://github.com/clearml/clearml/blob/master/examples/automation/task_piping_example.py)
    - This example will "process data", and once done, will launch a copy of the 'second step' experiment-template
- [Second step experiment](https://github.com/clearml/clearml/blob/master/examples/automation/toy_base_task.py)
    - In order to create an experiment-template in the system, this code must be executed once manually
