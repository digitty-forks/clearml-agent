"""SNUG integration helpers.

``resolve_shim_path()`` locates the shipped shared library (a Linux ``.so``
loaded via ``LD_PRELOAD`` or a macOS ``.dylib`` loaded via
``DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES``); when none is shipped for the platform it returns
None, ``snug_enabled()`` is False, and the executioner's behavior is unchanged.
``injection_env_var()`` is the matching per-OS preload env-var name.

``build_shim_descriptor_fd()`` hands the in-process reporter (linked into the
shim) the backend credentials + task identity + sink config it needs, via an
inherited fd whose number the agent exports as ``CLEARML_SNUG_CRED_FD``. On
Linux that fd is an anonymous ``memfd`` (nothing touches disk); on macOS (no
``memfd_create``) it is an immediately-unlinked 0600 temp file under the
per-user ``$TMPDIR``. The shim reads it at its ctor and reports to the ClearML
backend itself, in-process.

``macos_dyld_injection_supported()`` probes whether macOS SIP / hardened
runtime would strip ``DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`` from (or SIGKILL) a given
interpreter — it does for the system ``/usr/bin/python3`` — so the worker can
degrade gracefully (run the task WITHOUT SNUG) instead of silently no-op'ing or
crashing the task.

Naming convention: every constant/function on this module is the single
source of truth for its corresponding wire-level name (env var, runtime
property, file path). If you find yourself spelling one of these strings
literally elsewhere in the agent, import it from here instead.

    (``/var/folders/...`` on macOS) before the unlink. Same
    write->lseek0->set_inheritable discipline as the Linux memfd path; note
    ``mkstemp`` returns an O_CLOEXEC fd, so the ``set_inheritable(True)`` call is
    what makes it survive both execv and the pass_fds subprocess path.
