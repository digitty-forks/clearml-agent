//! Usage + task-metrics sinks: per-request reporting done inline in the
//! reporter's read loop.
//!
//! Both sinks join `RequestStarted` (which carries the host + whitelisted flag)
//! to the matching `RequestCompleted` (which carries the byte/token/latency
//! counts) by `conn_id`, gate on `whitelisted` AND on the request having a
//! resolved model (only actual LLM completions resolve one — a metered host
//! also serves non-LLM endpoints that, over HTTP/2, match the whitelist on host
//! alone; see the model gate in `usage`/`metrics`), then report against the
//! resolved provider:
//!
//!   * usage — per-request LLM usage to the backend `report_llm_usage`
//!     endpoint as a single event carrying the DISJOINT input split
//!     `prompt_tokens` (fresh) + `cache_read_tokens` + `cache_write_tokens`, plus
//!     `completion_tokens`, tagged `source="external"`, plus the model and
//!     provider. Skipped when both token counts are zero, or when the request
//!     resolved no model (a non-LLM call).
//!   * task-metrics — per-SECOND usage scalars to this task's SCALARS tab via
//!     `events.add_batch` (`training_stats_scalar`). The point series (tokens
//!     in/out, cache read/write, latency, bytes, requests) are a CONTINUOUS
//!     per-second time series: each second reports that second's accumulated
//!     traffic (tokens / bytes / request-count summed, latency averaged), and a
//!     second with NO traffic reports 0 — so every series is an uninterrupted
//!     rate-over-time line rather than a sparse point-per-call. One series per
//!     configured field, variant = provider (+ model when known, + chat ordinal
//!     when the request identified its conversation). Every series opens with a
//!     single 0 one second BEFORE its first captured second, so its line rises
//!     from 0 instead of jumping to the first real value. The x-axis (`iter`) is
//!     the whole-second offset from that origin (so the axis is elapsed wall-time
//!     in seconds), and `timestamp` carries that second's wall-time for the
//!     SCALARS Wall-Time/Relative axis (and `xaxis=iso_time` in an embedded
//!     Report). Idle seconds are 0-filled by a ~1 Hz clock tick
//!     driven from the reporter loop (`on_tick`), independent of traffic;
//!     requests advance the same clock (`advance_rate_clock`). A series 0-fills
//!     only while active — a variant idle past `RATE_IDLE_RETIRE_SECS` retires
//!     (stops emitting and is pruned), so a finished chat can't 0-fill forever
//!     (chat ids are never reused). It re-appears as a new segment if it resumes.
//!
//!     Two families stay PER-REQUEST (not per-second, not 0-filled), each on its
//!     own charts against a per-captured-request enumerator (`per_request_events`):
//!     each token field's "(cumulative)" running total, and tool activity — a
//!     SIGNAL line (0 idle / +1 used / -1 errored, errors dominate; aggregate per
//!     provider/chat and per tool name, so failures read as downward spikes) plus
//!     a CUMULATIVE chart (a monotonically-increasing running total of tool calls
//!     and of tool-call errors, a calls line + an errors line per provider/chat).
//!
//! Best-effort throughout: a backend error is logged to stderr and dropped so a
//! reporting failure never stalls metering.
