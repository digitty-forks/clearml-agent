//! Usage + task-metrics sinks: per-request reporting done inline in the
//! reporter's read loop.
//!
//! Both sinks join `RequestStarted` (which carries the host + whitelisted flag)
//! to the matching `RequestCompleted` (which carries the byte/token/latency
//! counts) by `conn_id`, gate on `whitelisted` AND on the request having a
//! resolved model (only actual LLM completions resolve one — a metered host
//! also serves non-LLM endpoints that, over HTTP/2, match the whitelist on host
//! alone; see the model gate in `usage`/`metrics`), then report against the
//! resolved provider:
//!
//!   * usage — per-request LLM usage to the backend `report_llm_usage`
//!     endpoint as a single event carrying the DISJOINT input split
//!     `prompt_tokens` (fresh) + `cache_read_tokens` + `cache_write_tokens`, plus
//!     `completion_tokens`, tagged `source="external"`, plus the model and
//!     provider. Skipped when both token counts are zero, or when the request
//!     resolved no model (a non-LLM call).
//!   * task-metrics — per-request usage scalars to this task's SCALARS tab via
//!     `events.add_batch` (`training_stats_scalar`): one series per configured
//!     field, variant = provider (+ chat ordinal when the request identified its
//!     conversation). The x-axis (`iter`) is a global enumerator that increments
//!     once per captured request, and `timestamp` carries the shim's capture
//!     wall-time — so the SCALARS Wall-Time/Relative axis (and `xaxis=iso_time`
//!     in an embedded Report) plots against real capture time, not send time.
//!     (`iter` is integer-only server-side, so wall-time can't ride it; it rides
//!     the float `timestamp`.) Tool activity is reported two ways: a SIGNAL — a
//!     line at 0 that jumps to +1 when a tool was used in a request and -1 when
//!     a tool result errored (errors dominate), both aggregate (per
//!     provider/chat) and per tool name, so failures read as downward spikes —
//!     and a CUMULATIVE chart: a monotonically-increasing running total of tool
//!     calls and of tool-call errors over the run (a calls line + an errors line
//!     per provider/chat), so the magnitudes-over-time sit alongside the
//!     at-a-glance spikes. No token filter (latency/bytes are meaningful at zero
//!     tokens). Each token field additionally gets a "(cumulative)" chart — the
//!     same per-series running-total treatment, so the per-request spikes sit
//!     alongside the totals accrued over the run.
//!
//! Best-effort throughout: a backend error is logged to stderr and dropped so a
//! reporting failure never stalls metering.
