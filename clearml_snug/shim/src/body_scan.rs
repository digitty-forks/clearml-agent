//! Response-body scanning to extract provider-reported token usage.
//!
//! The shim sees decrypted (post-TLS) but HTTP-layer-encoded bytes on
//! `SSL_read`. To read the real `usage` an LLM provider reports (instead of
//! the byte-ratio estimate), we feed each read chunk through a small,
//! per-response pipeline:
//!
//!   raw read bytes
//!     -> [1] accumulate + parse the HTTP response head (status, content-type,
//!            transfer-encoding) once
//!     -> [2] de-chunk if `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`
//!     -> [3a] SSE: split on lines, parse each `data:` event
//!        [3b] JSON: accumulate (capped), parse once at completion
//!     -> [4] extract the provider's usage fields
//!
//! Compression is handled upstream: the shim forces `Accept-Encoding:
//! identity` on whitelisted requests (see `inject.rs`), so bodies arrive as
//! plaintext JSON/SSE — no decompressor lives in the user's address space.
//!
//! Hot-path note: this only runs when a reporting sink is enabled
//! (`control::parse_usage_enabled()`) and the host is a known provider. A
//! cheap `"usage"` substring pre-filter gates the (relatively expensive)
//! `serde_json` parse, so the hundreds of `content_block_delta` SSE events in
//! a long completion are skipped with a byte scan — only the ~2 usage-bearing
//! events are actually parsed. All buffers are capped; any parse failure
//! simply leaves the measured value unset and the caller falls back to the
//! byte estimate.
